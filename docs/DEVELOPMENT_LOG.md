# Development log

This is the engineering record for Alveus. Entries distinguish merged work from
open pull requests, so proposed code is not mistaken for shipped code.

## 2026-11-14

### Merged into `main`

- **PR #18 — keyed ListModel synchronization.** Replaced repeated linear key
  searches with `Set`/`Map` lookups while preserving existing ListModel rows
  and delegates. Merge commit: `65a7beeb8ce62325458983d93f9f2f80ffc139ef`.
- The same merge added the GitHub Actions build/test workflow.

### Open pull requests (not yet in `main`)

- **PR #14:** background same-filesystem directory operations.
- **PR #15:** cached file placement and targeted fence-model updates.
- **PR #16:** GitHub Actions build and test pipeline.
- **PR #17:** headless UI harness and critical QML warning checks.

### In progress

- Persistent application diagnostics, a Settings → Diagnostics viewer, and
  this engineering log are being prepared in PR #19. They are not shipped until
  that pull request is merged.
